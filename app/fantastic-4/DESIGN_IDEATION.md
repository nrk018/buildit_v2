# Fantastic 4 — Retro-Futuristic Design Ideation

Each section has a **distinct** look while staying within a cohesive **Fantastic 4** retro-futuristic theme (cosmic, 80s sci‑fi, mission-control, comic-book tech).

---

## 1. **Hero** — COSMIC LAUNCH
- **Vibe:** Big superhero title, cosmic gradient, “mission start”.
- **Elements:** Existing gradient + giant “4” badge, Rock Salt + Audiowide, CTA buttons as “LAUNCH” controls.
- **Optional:** Very subtle CRT scanline overlay, soft glow on “4”.

---

## 2. **Overview** — MISSION BRIEFING
- **Vibe:** Top-secret briefing / mission file.
- **Elements:** Same blue gradient base; content in a “screen” frame (border like a monitor), amber/acid green accent for labels (PURPOSE, Phase 1/2, WHY PARTICIPATE). Slight monospace/terminal feel on headings.
- **Avoid:** Generic card stack; keep one clear “briefing” block.

---

## 3. **Timeline** — LAUNCH SEQUENCE
- **Vibe:** Countdown / flight plan / rocket stages.
- **Elements:** Vertical timeline with “stage” nodes; neon-style borders (blue/purple/green per phase); optional zigzag or stepped layout; each node feels like a “stage” (Ideathon → Hackathon → Winners). LIVE badge stays prominent.
- **Avoid:** Plain list; make phases feel like mission steps.

---

## 4. **Problems** — BRIEFING FILES / CASE LOG
- **Vibe:** Classified case files or lab experiment logs.
- **Elements:** Cards as “files” with case numbers (#001, #002); grid layout; industry as “classification”; tags as “tags”. Subtle border like a folder or document. Scroll/carousel keeps momentum.
- **Avoid:** Generic product cards; lean into “briefing” / “case” language in UI.

---

## 5. **Rules** — PROTOCOL / DIRECTIVE
- **Vibe:** Command-line rules / official protocol.
- **Elements:** Two blocks: Rules + Judging Criteria. Slightly sterner typography; optional thin “command” border or comic-panel frame; checkmarks as “COMPLIANCE” or “DIRECTIVE” icons. Numbered or bulleted list with clear hierarchy.
- **Avoid:** Playful cards; keep it “official” and readable.

---

## 6. **Stage 1 (Registration)** — ENLIST
- **Vibe:** Enlist in the mission / sign up for the crew.
- **Elements:** Strong CTA: REGISTER → PITCH DECK → SUBMIT. Numbered steps (1, 2, 3) like a checklist. Amber/yellow accent for “Stage 1”. Countdown or deadline clearly visible. Buttons feel like “confirm” actions.
- **Avoid:** Weak or buried CTAs.

---

## 7. **Stage 2 (Hackathon)** — CLASSIFIED
- **Vibe:** Locked / access denied until Stage 1 complete.
- **Elements:** Lock icon; “CLASSIFIED” or “ACCESS LOCKED” treatment; countdown to “unlock” (Ideathon deadline). Card with redacted or “restricted” feel. When unlocked (future), switch to “ACCESS GRANTED” style.
- **Avoid:** Looking like a normal section; it should feel “locked”.

---

## 8. **FAQ** — TRANSMISSION LOG / QUERY ARCHIVE
- **Vibe:** Archived transmissions / Q&A log.
- **Elements:** Accordion or expandable blocks; each Q like a “log entry”; optional terminal/monospace for questions; answers in clear body text. Subtle border or divider between entries.
- **Avoid:** Plain FAQ list; slight “archive” or “log” feel.

---

## 9. **Contact** — SIGNAL
- **Vibe:** Send a signal / open a channel.
- **Elements:** Minimal: email + phone (or links). Optional “TRANSMISSION” or “SIGNAL” heading; very light “sending” or “signal” visual (e.g. subtle pulse or line). Keep it clean and scannable.
- **Avoid:** Clutter; this is the calm closing section.

---

## Shared design language
- **Typography:** Audiowide for UI/headings; Rock Salt for hero “Fantastic 4”; system/mono for “terminal” hints.
- **Colors:** Deep blue gradient base; amber/yellow for Stage 1 and highlights; purple for timeline/phase 2; green for success/contact; red/amber for “live” or “locked”.
- **Borders:** Neon-like thin borders, “screen” frames, or comic-panel style where it fits.
- **No samey layout:** Each section uses a different layout (full-bleed hero, briefing block, timeline, file grid, two-column protocol, stepped CTAs, locked card, accordion log, minimal contact).
